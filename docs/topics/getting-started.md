[//]: # (title: Get started with Kotlin)

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) is a modern but already mature programming language designed to make developers happier.
It's concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.

Pick it up to start building powerful applications!

## Learn Kotlin fundamentals

* If you're already familiar with one or more programming languages and want to learn Kotlin, start with learning 
  Kotlin's [basic syntax](basic-syntax.md).
* If Kotlin is your first programming language, we recommend starting with the [Atomic Kotlin book](https://www.atomickotlin.com/atomickotlin/)
or signing up for the free [Kotlin Basics track](https://hyperskill.org/join/fromdocstoJetSalesStat?redirect=true&next=/tracks/18) on JetBrains Academy.
